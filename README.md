Nepali Data Classifiers

This project contans a list of files representing a category (e.g. Health, Education, Movie etc.). Within those files, 
you will find a list of hand picked curated list of Nepali Words that closely tie to that category. 

If you are using the Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning, you can use these classifiers to train your models.

Let's say you crawl an arcile from  a website and you want to classify that document into one of the broard categories, then you can utilize our classifiers to find what words are most represented within that article and classify it accordingly. 

The following classifiers from our project have been publicly released in this github.
<ul>
<li>Health Classifiers</li>
  <li>Religion and Festival Classifiers</li>
  <li>Nepali Actors List</li>
  <li>Nepali Actress List</li>
